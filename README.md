# OnlineTollPlazaSystem

Along with growing number of vehicles in major cities, Online Toll plaza is an
option for smooth transportation. Manual toll plazas are widely used for toll fee
collection in India but manual system requires lot of paperwork and are also prone
to errors, also increasing the processing time. Also, during festive seasons this
system may cause congestion leading to fuel wastage and causing pollution.
To overcome these issues, we introduce an online system to pay toll fee. This will
help to reduce the traffic at the toll plaza and will also help to save fuel resources
and reduce pollution which a major topic of concern these days.
The Toll system is available for use by both the administration and the user. The
administrator and users will use the webpage as a front end. The browser goes
through http server. Application server manages the connection between the front
end and backend, all types of information and data, that are necessary for the users
are stored in database server.
